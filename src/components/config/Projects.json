In spite of such hassle in investment in our market, we can never get the desired price for stock trading. At a moment, it is up and the other moment, it is down. So, there seems to be a requirement of quick market analysis to trade safely. Sometimes it takes a whole day to reach a pick point value and it happens out of the blue. Many people have experienced such atrocities in the so called, hassle market. To come up with a targeted solution, although very small, ‚ÄúStock Tracking System‚Äù program is built. It sums up to the easier mode of accessibility for us in the shares market. It is especially designed for the ease of use in stock value monitoring, where the user can enter a desired value for trading and the system utilizes the value to return result if the desired value is reached. However, this system is not only limited to tracking stock data but also displays the availability of active stocks and all the market parameters of a particular stock/share.",
